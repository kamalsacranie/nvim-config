# To Fix

## Lspsaga no signature

- Lspsaga refuses to show a signature at all ever
- It also refuses to show a hover doc

This is exceptionally weird because the regular LSP shows both

### Update

apparently this is a known issue according to [this](https://github.com/glepnir/lspsaga.nvim/issues/241) post
Maybe ill look into dropping lspsaga its not really actively maintained

## Add documnet hover highlighting

## CHnage wq

Change wq to wallq
